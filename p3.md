# P3: Hi-fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation

## Highlight Walkthrough

The main feature we chose to concentrate on implementing for this demo project was the My Garden feature, which allows the user to create a garden and add plants of their choice to it. Features that we also implemented in order to make the My Garden activity work include the profiles and plant searching components of the application.

### Main Menu

We had some features that have been added or changed since our Lo-Fi Prototype. To make everything more accessible, we added a navigation pop-up menu to the side of the screen. At first we were afraid it was redundant, but we added it anyway because we felt it didn't make the interface messy, but added a lot more flexibility for navigating to our different activities. We kept the big button menu for a similar reason. Even if it feels a bit slow to go through all the menus, our reasoning is that it makes it a lot easier to click with one hand while gardening.

### My Garden

Not much else has changed from our initial plans. We felt that our design of the My Garden interface was really intuitive and user-friendly. It clearly and cleanly lays out the user’s gardens, and allows quick access or modification of them. It feels well organized and easy to use, with as few elements as we could afford to add to the application. What we liked the most about the My Garden activity was the visibility of all the plants. We wanted it to be easy for users to see all their gardens and plants without it being a bland list, and having some sort of visual for usability.

### Suggestions

When we started designing the Create a Garden/ Add Plant activity of our project, we were careful not to bloat the interface with options and elements. One thing we added to this activity was the done button at the top right side of the screen. Initially, after creating a garden or adding a plant to an existing one, pressing back you bring you to the My Garden screen, and you would see the brand new garden/plants in the activity. However, feedback from our video prototype prompted us to make it clearer when a garden was created, or a plant was added. We feel the “done” button removes ambiguity from our application.

We chose to have a familiar form type of layout for adding plants. It wouldn't be an incredibly common activity. The screen shows suggestions but also has a search function to look for specific plants. It also displays a list of all the current plants in the garden so you won't have to go back and forth to see them all. We had a tile layout for the suggestions and search results, with a quantity add button in case users want to add more than one at a time.

### Profiles

Our profile screen didn’t change, but we cleaned up the options and changed some things that we felt weren’t useful for gardening at all, like favourite colour to garden colour. There are options for your garden preferences, which are there to help tailor suggestions for the user, and you can choose none or as many as you want. We also have a skill level. That way the app knows to suggest easy plants for beginners, or any plants for experts.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

When we brought all of our individual heuristic evaluations together, we all had very different heuristic violations which resulted in a wide range of issues that our interface needed to be improved upon. The spreadsheet below, which show all of our results pooled together, are sorted by the average severity rating that the group members had assigned this task. The reason for sorting them in this way is to easily see which issues need to be addressed if another iteration of this app were to be in development. Addressing the very large issues before moving to any polish is always a priority.

The top 5 violations are summarized as followed, with the heuristic they violate in brackets. We have no way of deleting gardens on our 'My Garden' page (User control and Freedom), there is no way of deleting plants from a garden (User control and Freedom), the profiles page doesn't support removing profiles (User control and Freedom), the quick side menu bar looks like a scrolling bar on some menu screens (Recognition rather than recall/Consistency and Standard), and there is no prompt telling you that you need to make a profile in order to create some gardens (Help and Documentation).

Two of these heuristic problems could be fixed with implementations of buttons that start a removal states. These button would by on the 'My Garden' page and the 'Profile' page to deal with removing whole gardens and profiles respectively. The plants already in the garden could probably be treated a little differently, where multiples of the same plant can be in a garden. Therefore, and edit button could be more appropriate, where you can decrease the amount of that plant you have. The violation that deals with the side menu bar can be easiy fixed by simply changing the icon. An arrow or something similar can indicate that someone should swipe instead of try to use it as a scroll bar. The most challenging fix would be to get people to create a profile before creating gardens. One solution we had was to have a walkthrough for a user when they first install the app and have them create a profile before they set up a garden. Some documentation could also be added to indicate you can have more than one profile, and to indicate that profiles help give plant suggestions to the user.
