# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Garden Grove is a gardening app that will aid in building and maintaining a successful garden, by removing the intimidation of starting a garden we hope to get more people gardening, and make it fun and easy in the process.  We will accomplish this by giving our users information convenience, plant organization, and maintenance scheduling.  Our app will be used by people who are looking to start a new garden and users that have started and are looking to get organized in their gardening.  We expect users to use our application on the go, at home in the garden to take the research and guess work out of how to maintain your garden by having readily available information that is focused towards the plants that the users have in their personal gardens. 

## Stakeholders and Users

- Garden Centre business' (such as Specialty Garden Stores, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, etc.)
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - These centers will have an increase in customers
  
- Garden Center employees
  - Potentially a User or Stakeholder
  - Could be experienced gardeners themselves
  - Make them more effective at their job
    - They can help customers in advanced ways rather than holding their hand while making a suggestions for plants
    - Help customers with actual problems
    
- Home Gardeners
  - This is the primary user in mind
  - Beginners
    - Help beginners to garden by providing a way to get the necessary information to care for plants in their garden
  - Experienced
    - Supplement to their gardening knowledge. It can help to lighten the cognitive load of remembering
      how and when to maintain every different plant of their garden
 
- Earth
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - More people planting gardens will help the environment
  - More people could grow their own food
  - Less lawns and more trees/plants/flowers being planted
 
- Farmers 
  - Primarily a stakeholder (We aren't targeting people who mass produce plants for profit)
  - People who grow the flowers/plants to be sold at retailers
  - Higher demand for their products

## User Research Methods

The three research methods we used were Secondary Research, an Interview, and Try it Yourself.

Our group thought Secondary Research would be incredibly helpful in finding what was found to be most important to users based on either previously made apps, or gardening guide websites, as well as providing solutions we wouldn’t have thought of on our own.

Interviews are a good way to talk with a user or stakeholder in a more intimate way.
People can express their frustrations and suggestions while the interviewer can also
learn from interviewee. Our application is concerned with gardening, particularly helping
beginners and experienced gardeners. Interviewing those who have gardening experience
can give us insight into what techniques and workarounds worked for them to maintain a garden, which we
can include into our design.

Try it yourself method was selected because a member in the group had previous experience with gardening and we felt first hand experience in starting a new garden would be beneficial in the design of a gardening app.  The experience level of this person also aligned with our research goals, as the person had started gardening a year prior, and are finding out new items from what happens after starting a garden, and the struggles with starting a garden with no experience.

### User Research Method 1: Secondary Research

![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image")

We downloaded and tried several existing apps that had similar goals as our planned applications, which helped us to understand what was currently being used by popular phone apps, and what we thought was bloat for what we intended to do. We got an idea of how existing garden app users are currently using features available to them and how they were implemented.

By doing this research we gained insight into the gardening community and found out what a big community it was.  Several of the gardening apps we looked into were largely focused on social media.  People apparently love to share photos of there gardens and flowers on social media. However many of the apps required you to create a profile to join the community, and utilized the community for information sharing regarding finding unknown plants and flowers, and determining if plants that appeared in their gardens were weeds.  Besides the posting of pictures and asking questions the flower and plant databases sometimes operated in wikipedia style manner where information regarding plants and flowers in the database were able to be added and edited by users in the community. 

This gave us a lot of insight into what garden apps are being used for currrently beyond just garden information.  Several garden information guides were also looked into, these were mostly basic apps that had set information, but what they did do was clean and simple and easy to use.  
 
What we found from our research was the importance including the sharing of pictures and information seems to be important. However, as this is fun for some people many users might like the being forced to share use the sharing and taking pictures of their gardens and may just enjoy the lurking to see what other people are doing and using it as an information source only, which is not an option on many of the apps. Soical media was not the initial intention of this app, however, the findings of this research will shape many of our potential features.


### User Research Method 2: Interview

![](https://github.com/wjhong1234/481-project-template/blob/master/Karen.jpg "Our Interviewee")

The gardening center we visited was Plantation Garden Centre, located at 2408 4 St. NW. When we parked, there was an employee heading back to the center after helping a customer load some plants into their car. We asked if she was willing to participate in our interview. She introduced herself as Karen. We asked her if she kept a garden recreationally, and she said that she called herself an 'experienced amateur'. When we asked for experience in years, she answered with 15-20 years.

When we asked her why she gardens, she replied that she enjoys watching them grow and that they look pretty.

When asked what type of plants she keeps in her garden, she said that she has some that she repeatedly needs to plant annually. She also keeps perennials, tomato, and cucumbers which reside in her small greenhouse.

We asked her if she had used an app to assist in her gardening. She didn't use a dedicated gardening app, she felt that millenials would benefit most from something like this. She used a browser to look up trivia about plants and occasionally information about how to take care of a plant.

Since she hadn't really used a dedicated application to help her garden, we asked what she would like to see in an app to assist with gardening. Her main concern was that it contained good information. This information included what soil and different plants needed, the location of local plant centers instead of the corporate giants like Wal-Mart and Home Depot. She also wanted some way to look up why things were going awry, such as why something won't bloom or why something is overly wet.

Lastly, we asked what would be the things that beginner gardeners struggle with the most. She emphasized the lack of knowledge beginners have about the sun and the shade. Some plants can get away with being in the shade more than others, but the rest could die without proper placement in your garden

There are some interesting things we can draw from this interview. What striked me was that she called herself an 'experienced amateur' even with 15 years of experience under her belt. This can suggest that gardening is way more in depth than we had perceived and definitely could warrant more research into the topic. However, we do have to mind that since she does this recreationally, she may not be tending a vast garden. Another finding that causes question is the fact that Karen uses things like a browser to look up trivia and information about plants, but she doesn't use a dedicated application to do so. Maybe she's content with using google to find her information, or maybe gardening apps aren't marketed to her as well. Either way, it suggests that our apps have to have some more appeal other than being some sort of search engine or database. Another comment that Karen made was that millenials would benefit most from this app. She's suggesting people older than the millenials wouldn't really find a use for this. This suggests that we should either create a design that could appeal to the older generation, or this could signal us to focus on the younger. We need to take this into consideration when we review our task descriptors.

### User Research Method 3: Try it Yourself

![](https://github.com/wjhong1234/481-project-template/blob/master/Before%20Gardening.JPG "Garden Beforehand")
 
This group member started out with no experience and went into gardening with no research because they felt that "gardening is easy" I dont need to do research.  After clearing out the existing weed bed they started with a blank slate and went at it.  Their planting and planning methods we unorganized and seemed to go with the flow with watering schedules and maintenance.  After a year of planting their garden, 13 of the 18 plants planted survived, and some plants that should haven been tended to after the seasons end should have been tended to but were not.

After everything was planted and growing, they ended up not being happy with the planting layout and wanted to switch around the location of some of the plants. Spacing was a bit of a problem as well as some plants were much larger and not what was expected.

They have indicated that not remembering what the plants they bought is not ideal, and could probably could do some searching to find them but are not that concerned.  The tag they got with the plant was tossed out and is not something expected to  be kept, or even stick next to the flower in your garden.  By getting rid of the tags they had no idea what to do for maintenance at the end of the season or what to do at the beginning of next season.

Other takeaways from this experience would be that the user had no idea how to plant the items they had properly without guidance from the people who worked at the garden center.  Not all plants are planted in the same manner, for example their experience with planting their orchid may have gone wrong if the garden center employee did not inform them othe proper method ahead of time.  

The advantage of this study is to get an opposite view from type of gardener interviewed.  The user didn't look for an app to use because they initially thought most free apps are not any good, and had no intention of signing up for using a garden app at the time either.  They were a casual gardener looking for low maintenance plants and minimum effort to keep them alive and looking good.

- **Interview: Questions asked and Photo**
  1. Why do you garden?
  2. What kind of plants do you have in your garden?
  3. Do you use a gardening app?
  4. What features did you like in the gardening app? If you didn't use one, what features would you like in an app?
  5. What do you think beginner gardeners struggle with most?
  
- **Do It Yourself:**
 
  - **Subject:** Philip Borowoy
 
  - **Experience at start:** None 
 
  - **Experience at end:** 1 year, starting year 2
 
  - **Garden Size:** 4 gardens 2’x 3’
  
  - **Plants:** Tree (type forgotten), hostas, other plants/flowers that are unknown, herbs
 
Why I got into gardening, to improve the look of my house.  Existing garden beds were not maintained and overgrown, had existing structure, might as well do something with it.
 
I grow herbs for cooking and to save money, or that was the plan, then only parsley grew from all the seeds I bought, am currently starting new plants: chives, tomatoes, oregano
 
  - **Tools Owned:**
 
    - Wheel Barrow 
    - Various shovels
    - Flexible Rake
 
  - **Tools Bought:**
    - Tiny planting shovel
    - Weed killer
 
I was buying tools as I had money (I planned to start gardening ahead of time) / needed them for other reasons
 
  - **What I did in the beginning:** 
 
I had no idea what I was doing so I looked online for a garden center in my area, didn’t want to goto home depot, thought the employees at a specialized garden center would have better employees, looked for a non busy  employee that didn’t look like a young adult at a summer job, because they would most likely have knowledge of plants as they more likely are a long term employee.  Found one and it worked, she had other work  but to do but  didn’t look too busy she was very nice and helpful and showed plants based on what I was trying to do/colour scheme , the size of the space I was planting in, and also showed me what to look for on the tags when shopping for plants.
 
  - **What I first found out:**
 
They sell plants that are not suited to be planted in Calgary, you have to look at tags and they tell you the “zone” of the plants are suited for.  I first thought that if someone is selling outdoor plants in Calgary they are suited for being planted in Calgary outdoors.  
Perennials are plants that come back the next year, they were in a different section than plants that don’t come back each year, still not sure if this is common in big box stores
 
There were 3 different price points that plants are sold at the garden center, depending on the size of the plant 
 
Wal-Mart sells mulch a ¼ the cost of the garden centers, I have not noticed a big difference in the price of the plants, trees, flowers in the big box stores I have shopped at compared to garden centers expect for dirt, mulch, grass seed, things along those lines garden centers give you a huge advantage in selection compared to big box stores
 
  - **My Experience:**
 
Planting these plants was easy enough I had planted a few trees before for my parents so the tree went in good.  Flowers and low lying shrubs I have never planted before but I followed the same general planting procedure for all the plants as I did for the tree, except the orchid, which the lady who helped me told to plant shallow with the bulb exposed from the top of the soil when I planted it.   I was skeptical but it survived the winter.  
 
Right off the bat a few plants just didn’t seem to take, nothing I tried seem to bring them back from wanting to die.  Found out plants that you buy that die in the first year are eligible for a replacement plant, so I took a picture of the sad looking twigs in the ground that were the remaining pieces of the plant, found out they wanted the actual root system or no refund.  Makes sense.
 
Of the 18 plants I originally planted 13 are still around.  I thought less, but more keep popping up , so maybe more are alive but haven’t sprouted much for the new season. 
 
There is one plant that I should have trimmed I think over the winter or maybe this spring, still need to but the plant is growing fine without it so I am leaving it for now, maybe those branches come back later.
 
I still have no idea what I’m doing, but learning things all the time.
