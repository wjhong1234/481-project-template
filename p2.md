# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

The video prototype below walks through the task description in P1 that featured Freya Jones. As a recap:

- Freya Jorrvaskr
	- Freya joins her father regularly on Saturdays to help maintain the suburban backyard that she and her parents have.
	  She is usually tasked with watering the lawn and the young apple tree while her father handles everything else.
	
	- She decides that she wants to have a small garden consisting of blue, yellow, and red flowers in their backyard,
	  and she wants to maintain it all on her own without her father's help.
	
	- After telling her father, she finds three types of flowers that have the coloration she wants, but are also easy to maintain. On a new day, and eager to start, Freya finds where to get the flowers and immediately informs her father.
	
	* Freya is 12 years old
	* Freya is a beginner to gardening
	* She only plays on flashy apps on her iPod

However, we tweaked the task description to include Freya entering profile information so that the recommendation feature can draw on some information to suggest some flowers to Freya, rather than mysteriously knowing what flowers Freya would like. We also don't show
how Freya is supposed to find which store has these flowers as we haven't worked out how to display such information to the user yet.
We wanted to focus on the menu design and interaction, the sliding pot interface and the suggestions menu in this video prototype.

Details of how we came to prototype these designs are further in this document.

## Storyboard

The objective we chose for our storyboard was to add a plant (tulips) to an existing garden group. The first frame of the storyboard depicts the user pressing the ‘My Garden’ button of our possible menu layout. It brings the user to the 'My Garden' activity, which displays the different gardens the user currently has. The user presses the add button corresponding to the garden they wish to add a plant to, and the search plant screen is opened. There exists suggestions for the user to choose, but in this example, the user decides to look for tulips using the search bar. The results pop-up, and the user selects the second option. A confirmation is given to ensure the user adds the correct plant. The final frame depicts the garden after the tulip is added, with the most recent addition in the leftmost pot.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

The task centered walkthrough evaluates the task Freya has while using the interface we provided in the video prototype. The changes
we made to the task description are reflected in the task steps.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

![All Sketches](https://wjhong1234.github.io/481-project-template/HCI%20P2%20Pictures/All%20Ideas%203.jpg "All Sketches")

At the beginning of our sketching sessions, the group sat down and reviewed the main takeaways from P1: organization, social media, and friendly to older generations.  We were unsure what to expect from our sketches, but we thought to have two separate sketching sessions to allow us to refocus our efforts and build off what came up with in the first session. To prevent a large array of different sketches from the group in our first sketching session, we decided it would be best to focus on the menu screen, sharing pictures, and garden organization.  After the first session, each group member explained the ideas and purposes of their sketches and the rest of the group members talked about what they thought were the pros and cons of the sketches being explained.  From the first session, we had a few duplicate ideas and thought that the ideas were a little reserved. We needed some more out of the box thinking, so during the second session, we took ideas from the first session and built on them. We felt for the second session we exhausted options for menus as we had done some brainstorming in tutorial on the menu already, so the second session focused more on organization and planning.  After the new sketches were explained, we reflected on what we thought were the best ideas based on our app criteria, and what was realistically able to be implemented into our app.

During our affinity diagram session, we organized our sketches into 5 different groupings: 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
The 'Big Buttons' group is as the title suggests. It contains sketches that featured large buttons.
Some sketches in this group included menu screens that feature one big picture as a button, or a 
very simple menu with three large buttons.
From our P1 research, our interviewee (Karen) mentioned that applications for gardens wouldn't suit 
her demographic. Bigger buttons could help accomodate older users.
The strengths of a Big Button interface include easy of programming, simple design, 
and would be easy and intuitive to use from the user's perspective.
Some weaknesses include originality, as many different applications have large buttons.
It could potentially hide a lot customizability or information since the application screen is taken up by
these buttons.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

'Visualization' is a group that focuses on graphical representations to convey information. Sketches
that fall into this category include a 3D box that displays your garden, or a feature that can show your garden
in different seasons. From our Try It Yourself research, organization was a prominent issue in gardening.
These sketches describe potential solutions to help with visually organizing one's garden. Sketches in this group are very original,
and if it was implemented, could be intuitive to use and helpful. But the drawback of these sketches is
the feasibility of such ideas. Accessible tech for consumers doesn't exist yet for the virtual reality
box in particular.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Another group we created was an 'Information Gathering' group. This group focuses on organizing information
into groups. This was something that we found helpful in finding information that people needed. It is easy to implement,
and can provide a lot of information in one place. Out of all the groups, these ideas promote organization the
most. Some of the sketches have good originality by using graphical interfaces to choose options. However, if
we do not group information intuitively or make the controls smooth, it could be very difficult for users to
find the things that they want.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

'Sharing' explores the social media aspect that we found in our secondary research from P1. Some sketches
in this group feature the share button, and a more gamified way to share what a gardener is planting. Save for
the gamified sharing method, most of the sketches aren't too original, but it helps with familiarity for our
users and would be both simple to implement and to use. The gamified sharing feature would be difficult to implement
as well.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Our 'Planning' group focuses on the way users are able to use our app to help them plant things in their garden.
While 'Visualization' focuses on showing what the plants will look like once they're planted, 'Planning' answers the
question of where one should put their plants in the first place. Some sketches featured here are grid interfaces,
as well as augmented reality, or other graphical representations. A lot of the sketches in this group are original, but
most are also hard to implement, such as the Augmented Reality plant placer, or the 3D model representations of
gardens. Not to mention that some of these features take up a lot of screen space, like the grid organizers. Grid
organizers could be harder to use for the older demographic.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

The 3 most promising sketches that our group chose was the 'Big Picture Menu', 'Simple Sharing', and the 'Sliding
Pot Layout'.

The 'Big Picture Menu' features a menu that cycles through big pictures that take up most of the screen, allowing only one clickable
picture at a time. A user would cycle through these picture by either swiping left or right, or using the arrow buttons on the side.
This was a promising design because of simplicity and has a good use of graphics. The buttons are a nice feature that help
with using the phone with one hand, as we imagine some users could use the app while handling tools or plants in the 
other hand. These are things that help accomodate older users and make it more appealing to use through its pictures rather than
flat coloured rectangles as buttons.

We chose the 'Simple Sharing' sketch, which features a camera that has a simple share button. We felt that familiarity would be a strength when it came to sharing pictures. Before conducting our user research, we hadn't considered social media as an aspect of our application, but found through our secondary research that a lot of gardening apps on the market today have some social aspect to them.
While we decided social media shouldn't be the sole purpose of our application, we acknowledge that some sharing functionality would be good to have.

The last sketch is a blend of two sketches. The sketch features potted plants on sideways scrollable tables. Each table represents a different garden around one's living space and the potted plants show what plants are in that particular garden. The recommendation and search system of one of the sketches is grouped into this sketch, particularly with adding a new plant to one of the gardens. The recommendations of this system helps newer gardeners pick plants that suited to their preferences, while the search option allows users to find particular plants that they want. The strength of this feature is its visual appeal. Most of the functionality for this is demonstrated in our storyboard and video prototype.

## Reflection

Looking back on the development of our Lo-Fi prototype, we feel each stage was beneficial to our design.  During Sketching/Brainstorming we came up with many new ideas that we could use and combine based on what we liked and met our expectations.  Even though some were a bit extreme in application the peer evaluation for each sketch we did kept us in check of what was realistic, and helped us decide on the functions that we would include in the app while still maintaining our goal of making it easy to use.

While interacting with the prototype we found that there were some issues with some of our interactions and made notes on what we would like to change.  Pretending to be Freya for the Task-Centered System Walkthrough, and critically thinking of what was intuitive, limiting, and useful at each stage of our walkthrough we found many more flaws in our system that we didn’t consider in the initial design.   We felt this process was the very beneficial in showing us how our expectations of our app were different from how others would perceive it.

One thing we would change in our process would be to have made several revisions to our Lo-Fi prototype to take care of the obvious interaction flaws that we encountered in our demonstration, however due to time constraints we were only able to produce one.  Overall, we feel that the development and construction of our Lo-Fi prototype was a great success.  All steps went smoothly and in the end, we gained excellent insight into our design mistakes that we need to address.
