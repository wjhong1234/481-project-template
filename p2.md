# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

The video prototype below walks through the task description in P1 that featured Freya Jones. As a recap:

- Freya Jorrvaskr
	- Freya joins her father regularly on Saturdays to help maintain the suburban backyard that she and her parents have.
	  She is usually tasked with watering the lawn and the young apple tree while her father handles everything else.
	
	- She decides that she wants to have a small garden consisting of blue, yellow, and red flowers in their backyard,
	  and she wants to maintain it all on her own without her father's help.
	
	- Telling her father this, she finds three types of flowers that have the coloration she wants, but are also
	  easy to maintain. With her daughter eager to start and the day just starting, she finds where to get these flowers
	  immediately and tells her father.
	
	* Freya is 12 years old
	* Freya is a beginner to gardening
	* She only plays on flashy apps on her iPod

However, we tweaked the task description to include Freya entering profile information so that the recommendation feature can draw on some information to suggest some flowers to Freya, rather than mysteriously knowing what flowers Freya would like. We also don't show
how Freya is supposed to find which store has these flowers as we haven't worked out how to display such information to the user yet.
We wanted to focus on the menu design and interaction, the sliding pot interface and the suggestions menu in this video prototype.

Details of how we came to prototype these designs are further in this document.

The storyboard above depicts a user navigating the sliding pot layout to add a new plant to one of their gardens. They look up a plant through the search bar and view its information before adding it to the garden.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

The task centered walkthrough evaluates the task Freya has while using the interface we provided in the video prototype. The changes
we made to the task description are reflected in the task steps.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

![](https://wjhong1234.github.io/481-project-template/HCI%20P2%20Pictures/All%20Ideas%203.jpg "All Groupings")

At the beginning of our sketching sessions the group sat down and reviewed the main takeaways from P1: organization, social media, and friendly to older generations.  We were unsure what to expect from our sketches but we thought to have two separate sketching sessions to give an opportunity to refocus our efforts and build off what came out of the first session.   To prevent a large array of different sketches from the group in our first sketching session we decided it would be best to focus on the menu screen, sharing pictures, and garden organization.  After the first session, each group member explained the ideas and purpose for their sketches and the rest of the group members talked about what they thought were the pros and cons of the sketches being explained.  From the first session, we had a few duplicate ideas and thought that the ideas were a little reserved we needed some more out of the box thinking and took ideas from the first session and built on them. We felt for the second session we exhausted options for menus as we had done some brainstorming in tutorial on the menu already so the second session focused on organization and planning.  After the new sketches were explained we reflected on what we thought were the best ideas based on our app criteria, and what was realistic to be able to implemented into our app.

During our affinity diagram session, we organized our sketches into 5 different groupings.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
The 'Big Buttons' group is as the title suggests, it included sketches that featured large buttons.
Some sketches in this group include menu screens that feature one big picture as a button, or a 
very simple menu with three large buttons.
From our P1 research, our interviewee (Karen) mentioned that applications for gardens wouldn't suit 
her demographic. Bigger buttons could help accomodate older users.
The strengths of Big Button interface would be that it is easier to program, has a simpler design, 
and would be easy and intuitive to use from the users perspective.
Some weaknesses is that originality is not as prominent, many different applications have large buttons.
It could potentially hide a lot customizability or information since the application screen is taken up by
these buttons.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

'Visualization' is a group that focuses on graphical representations to convey information. Sketches
that fall into this category is a 3D box that shows your garden, or a feature that can show your garden
in different seasons. From our try it yourself research, organiztion was a prominent issue in gardening.
These sketches can help with visually organizing one's garden. Sketches in this group are very original
and if it was implemented, could be intuitive to use and helpful. But the drawback of these sketches is
the feasibility of such ideas. Accessible tech for consumers doesn't exist yet for the virtual reality
box in particular.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Another group we created was an 'Information Gathering' group. This group focuses on organizing information
into groups. This was something that helps to find information that people need. It is easy to implement,
and can give a lot of information in one place. Out of all the groups, these ideas promote organization the
most. Some of the sketches have good originality by using graphical interfaces to choose options. However, if
we do not group information intuitively or make the controls smooth, it could be bery difficult for users to
find the things that they want.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

'Sharing' explores on the social media aspect that we found in our secondary research from P1. Some sketches
in this group feature the share button, and a more gamified way to share what a gardener is planting. Save for
the gamified sharing method, most of the sketches aren't too original, but it helps with familiarity with our
users and would be both simple to implement and use. The gamified sharing feature would be harder to implement
as well.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Our 'Planning' group focuses on the way users are able to use our app to help them plant things in their garden.
While 'Visualization' focuses on showing what the plants will like once they're planted, 'Planning' answers the
question of where one should put their plants in the first place. Some sketches featured here are grid interfaces
as well as augmented reality or graphical representations. A lot of the sketches in this group are original, but
most are also hard to implement, such as the Augmented Reality plant placer, or the 3D model representations of
gardens. Not to mention that some of these features take up a lot of screen space, like the grid organizers. Grid
organizers could be harder to use for the older demographic.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

The 3 most promising sketches that our group chose was the 'Big Picture Menu', 'Simple Sharing', and the 'Sliding
Pot Layout'.

The 'Big Picture Menu' features a menu that cycles through big pictures that take up most of the screen, allowing only one clickable
picture at a time. A user would cycle through these picture by either swiping left or right, or using the arrow buttons on the side.
This was a promising design because of its use of simplicity and good use of graphics. The buttons are a nice feature that helps
with using the phone with one hand, as we imagine some users could use the phone in one hand while handling tools or plants in the 
other hand. These are things that help accomodate older users and make it more appealing to use through its pictures rather than
flat coloured rectangles as buttons.

We chose the 'Simple Sharing' sketch, which features a camera that has a simple share button. We felt that familiarity would be a strength when it came to sharing pictures. Before conducting our user research, we hadn't considered social media as an aspect of our application, but found through our secondary research that a lot of gardening apps on the market today have some social aspect to them.
While we decided social media shouldn't be the sole purpose of our application, we acknowledge that some social functionality would be good to have.

The last sketch is a blend of two sketches. The sketch features potted plants on sideways scrollable tables. Each table represents a different garden around one's living space and the potted plants show what plants are in that particular garden. The recommendation and search system of one of the sketches is grouped into this sketch, particularly with adding a new plant to one of the gardens. The recommendations of this system helps newer gardeners pick plants that suited to their preferences, while the search option allows users to find particular plants that they want. The strength of this feature is its visual appeal. More of this sketches functionality is demonstrated in our storyobard and video prototype.
