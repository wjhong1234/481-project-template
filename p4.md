# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

GardenIt is the first iteration of a User Centered System Design (UCSD) to design an app that helped people start gardening while being a useful tool to an experienced gardener.  In the intvestigate stage of the the USCD we interviewed our users, tried gardening ourselves and reseached other phone applications.  From this research we learned valuable information about our users, their routines and struggles they faced while gardening, and current trends in the garden app world.  With this information we started the Ideate phase of our USCD and developed the features we thought our users would benefit from in a gardening app. From our brainstorming and affinity diagraming, we came up with developing a 1st iteration lo-fi prototype that had a focus on big button menu items for easy targeting with our users, information organization, and easy garden start suggestions.  After evalution of the lo-fi prototype we created a hi-fi prototype for our evaluate phase of the USCD.  In the evaluate phase we performed a heuristic evaluation to give a critical look at how our users would interact with our app and the issues they would encounter.  From the heuritic evaluation we found major issues with management after adding gardens and plants to a users profile, and with a lot of aesthetic issues with our app.  The next iteration of our USCD would be to go back to  the investigate phase and learn more information about our users using different IDEO methods in developing a garden layout organizer for our app as well as address the issues that were apparent in our heuristc evaluation.

## Introduction

GardenIt is a gardening application that puts its focus towards managing and maintaining a garden. We wanted to create a user friendly tool not only for those that want to start gardening, but also something for the more experienced users. We designed an application that gives users a system to organize their plants and to provide easy access to information in regards to the steps for taking care of the plants in their garden. One of our main goals when designing the app was to ensure our interface was intuitive and easy to learn, so it could be useful for most people despite their familiarity with technology. We wanted our app to provide useful assistance to the user and enhance their gardening experience.

## Design Problem

Our design problem was focused on assisting users who want to start gardening but have no prior experience. We really want to help beginners by giving them information in digestable pieces and give them tools to do tasks such as regular watering schedules and planning the physical layout of gardens. We also want the application to stick with user after they had gained gardening experience. In other words, the application should still be useful to experienced gardens. We want to target a wide range of users from children to seniors. Futhermore, since gardening is a hands on activity, we want to be able to use our application on a phone and with one hand, so that users could use our application while gardening.

## User Research and Findings

We performed 3 different User Research methods to better understand our user base. We conducted an interview with a garden centre employee, tried gardening in one of our backyards, and performed secondary research by examining different gardening apps on our phones.

We interviewed an employee named Karen at a local gardening centre. The major findings resulting from the interview was the fact that Karen called herself an "Experienced Amateur" after 15 years of experience. This suggests more user research into gardening. Karen used Google to search up her plant facts and to get gardening help. A search function or using a Google API could feel familiar to users who use the same technique. The last major finding was her belief that only millennials would benefit from a gardening application. This suggests a design decision. The product's design will either assume that its users will be technologically savvy, or that the products design will make it easier for infrequent users of technology to use.

Our second user research method was a member of our team tending to a garden of his own. The major problem encountered during this research was the lack of knowledge one has when tending to their first garden. The product needs to be able to deliver important gardening information at a moments notice.

Our final research method was secondary research into what features current gardening applications on the market possess. After looking at a handful of gardening applications, we found that almost all of them had implemented social media feaures such as sharing and viewing other people's photos of their gardens and plants. They also liked to post gardening questions that other users in the community would be able to answer. With social media features being prevalent in all these applications, it may be benefitial for our product to adopt some social media features as well.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

We found several problems during our heuristic evaluations, but there were three that stuck out like a sore thumb. These problems could be addressed in future iterations of course, but for now, they’re the weak spots of our application. Firstly, we are missing several delete buttons in the app. In our profiles screen, we cannot remove profiles after adding them, and in the My Garden screen, there is no option to delete entire gardens. Single plants can be deleted however. This is a quick fix, and we could easily add remove buttons for each.

It was a bad design choice to have the rounded bar icon as the pull out icon for our navigation menu. It was a bit overlooked to be honest, as we didn’t feel that it was a necessary part of our application until later on. We didn’t really think it was that bad, until during our heuristic evaluation, several members forgot it was there, and thought it was a scroll bar. The ultimate solution for this problem is to make the icon an arrow of some sort, instead of the current bar.

The most notable problem of our application was that a profile was required to create gardens. This isn’t immediately obvious to users coming into the application, and it would be difficult to motivate users to go through all the settings in order to create one. A solution we found acceptable was to have a prompt the first time the app is opened, requiring a user to create a profile before proceeding, but perhaps eliminating the profiles section altogether could be a design choice we’d discuss in future iterations.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

There were some parts of the application we didn’t get to focus a lot on, and some ideas we’d like to explore further. One feature we implemented was the simple sharing feature. After getting some feedback from Kody and discussing it a bit more with each other, we had a hard time justifying the need for a sharing feature on the application. In future iterations, we would want to either change sharing and incorporate the aspect into our application a lot more so it feels less out of place, or remove it entirely.

The suggestions feature of our application wasn’t fully fleshed out and we didn’t have a clear idea of how it would work, since it wasn’t one of our major focuses. In future iterations, we’d like to figure out the best way for plant suggestions to work, perhaps by having suggestions be influenced by previous plant additions, and perhaps a survey in the user profiles.

One of the big ideas we got from brainstorming was a grid layout organizer. We decided to not focus on it because it was difficult to implement in the time given, but if we could, it would be a great tool for gardeners to better layout their gardens, and organize their different plants. We don’t know how it would work, but one idea was to have a 2D bird’s eye view with different grid sizes, or to have a augmented reality kind of setup.

For all these ideas, we’d like to get more information from our users about how we should implement them.
